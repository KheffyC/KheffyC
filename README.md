## Kheffy Cervantez - @KheffyC

Hi, I'm Kheffy - a full stack software developer currently working on open source projects and volunteer work around California. I recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program where I learned MVC frameworks and how to work on full stack projects through their entire lifecycle. On the weekends I'm an entertainment drummer for the LA Kings and an instructor for a non-profit organization based in Corona, CA. 

## My Skills
- Node.js
- React
- Express
- MongoDB
- Python
- Django
- PostgresQl
- AWS s3

## How I work

My motivations are to be apart of a company that helps steer all generations towards technology. That tends to manifest in helping small businesses create websites for better outreach, or volunteering to help out those who cant afford progression. If theres a way to help with the ideas I have, I'll always be willing to share them.
